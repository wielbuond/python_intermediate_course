* Similar in almost all programming language
* Some minor differences like in JavaScript minutes are ``i``, not ``M``


Leading Zero
------------
* ``%#H`` - remove leading zero (Windows)
* ``%-H`` - remove leading zero (macOS, Linux, \*nix)
* ``%_H`` - replace leading zero with space (macOS, Linux, \*nix)
* Works only with formatting
* raises ValueError while parsing [#pydocdtformat]_

Datetime Timestamp
==================


What is timestamp?
------------------
* Seconds since midnight of January 1st, 1970 (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)
* Unix era, also known as "epoch"
* In most systems represented as 32-bit integer
* Max value is 2,147,483,647 (2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC)
* Min value is -2,147,483,647 (1901-12-13 20:45:52 UTC)
* If you add 1 to max value, you will get overflow to min value
* Linux kernel 5.6 (released 29 March 2020) has a fix for this problem so that 32-bit systems can run beyond the year 2038

Daylight Saving Time
--------------------
* Daylight Saving Time date is different for each country and even US state
* Australia is 9h 30m shifted
* India is 3h 30m shifted
* Nepal is 3h 45m shifted
* In southern hemisphere the Daylight Saving Time is opposite direction
* They subtract hour in March and add in October
* Samoa is on the international date line
* Samoa changed from UTC-1200 to UTC+1200 for easier trades with Australia
* During World War II England was GMT+0200
* Libya in 2013 discontinued DST with couple of days notice
* Israel is on a different timezone than Palestine (multiple timezones in one location, based on nationality)
* Change from Julian to Gregorian calendar caused to skip few weeks
* In 18th century World change from Julian to Gregorian calendar
* In 20th century Russia change from Julian to Gregorian calendar (different days which was skipped than for worldwide change)
* In britain until 16th century the year started on 25th of March
* Mind leap seconds (add, subtract)
* UTC includes leap seconds
* Astronomical time does not include leap seconds
* Google invented smear second (on the day of leap second) they add a small fraction of a second to each second that day until midnight
