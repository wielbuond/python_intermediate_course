* ``re.VERBOSE`` - ignores spaces (except ``\s``) and allows for comments in in ``re.compile()``
* ``re.DEBUG`` - display debugging information during pattern compilation


ASCII
-----
* Short: ``a``
* Long: ``re.ASCII``
* Perform ASCII-only matching instead of full Unicode matching
* Works for ``\w``, ``\W``, ``\b``, ``\B``, ``\d``, ``\D``, ``\s`` and ``\S``
* ASCII only search is faster, but does not include unicode characters


IGNORECASE
----------
* Short: ``i``
* Long: ``re.IGNORECASE``
* Case-insensitive search
* Has Unicode support i.e. ``Ą`` and ``ą``


LOCALE
------
* Short: ``L``
* Long: ``re.LOCALE``
* Case-insensitive matching dependent on the current locale
* Work for ``\w``, ``\W``, ``\b``, ``\B``
* Use of this flag is discouraged as the locale mechanism is very unreliable
* It only works with 8-bit locales


MULTILINE
----------
* Short: ``m``
* Long: ``re.MULTILINE``
* Match can start in one line, and end in another
* Changes meaning of ``^``, now it is a start of a line
* Changes meaning of ``$``, now it is an end of line


DOTALL
------
* Short: ``s``
* Long: ``re.DOTALL``
* Dot (``.``) matches also newline characters
* By default newlines are not matched by ``.``


UNICODE
-------
* Short: ``u``
* Long: ``re.UNICODE``
* On by default
* Turns on unicode character support
* Works for ``\w`` and ``\W``


VERBOSE
-------
* Short: ``x``
* Long: ``re.VERBOSE``
* Ignores spaces (except ``\s``) and allows for comments in in ``re.compile()``


DEBUG

Regex Syntax Look Ahead/Behind
==============================


Syntax

Regex Syntax Flavors
====================
* In other programming languages
* PCRE - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions


Future
------
* Since Python 3.11
* Atomic grouping ``((?>...))`` and possessive quantifiers (``*+``, ``++``, ``?+``, ``{m,n}+``) are now supported in regular expressions.
* https://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html
* https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/34627


Enclosing
