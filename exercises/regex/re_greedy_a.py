* Assignment: RE Qualifier Lazy
* Complexity: easy
* Lines of code: 4 lines
* Time: 8 min

English:
    1. Using `re.findall()` and lazy qualifier split text by paragraphs
    2. In `result: str` catch paragraf starting with "We choose to go to the moon"
    3. Run doctests - all must succeed

Polish:
    1. Używając `re.findall()` i lazy qualifier podziel tekst na paragrafy
    2. W `result: str` uchwyć paragraf zaczynający się od słów "We choose to go to the moon"
    3. Uruchom doctesty - wszystkie muszą się powieść

Hints:
    * All HTML paragraphs starts with `<p>` and ends with `</p>`
    * In real life paragraphs parsing is more complex
    * You can iterate over the results of `re.findall()`

Test:
    >>> assert type(result) is str, 'result must be a str'
    >>> assert not result.startswith('<p>'), 'result cannot start with <p>'
    >>> assert not result.endswith('</p>'), 'result cannot end with </p>'

    >>> result  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    'We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade
     and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are
     hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our
     energies and skills,because that challenge is one that we are willing to
     accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to
     win, and the others, too.'
