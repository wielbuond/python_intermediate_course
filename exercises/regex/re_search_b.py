Hints:
    * All HTML paragraphs starts with `<p>` and ends with `</p>`
    * In real life paragraphs parsing is more complex

Tests:
    >>> import sys; sys.tracebacklimit = 0

    >>> assert type(result) is str, 'result must be a str'
    >>> assert not result.startswith('<p>'), 'result cannot start with <p>'
    >>> assert not result.endswith('</p>'), 'result cannot end with </p>'

    >>> result  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    'We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade
     and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are
     hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our
     energies and skills,because that challenge is one that we are willing to
     accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win,
     and the others, too.'
