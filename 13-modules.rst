==============


Module venv
===========
* Isolated Python environment
* Allows to have multiple versions of Python for one project
* For testing on different versions: ``python3.9``, ``python3.10``, ``python3.11``
* Test libraries and frameworks before upgrading (create venv, install requirements, run tests, delete if fails)
* Allows to have different versions of libraries and frameworks for each project
* Difference between ``venv`` and ``virtualenv``
* ``venv`` is bundled with Python since 3.3 (no installation required)
* ``virtualenv`` is independent package installed via ``pip``
* ``virtualenvwrapper`` is additionally installed command line tools


Venv vs Virtualenv
------------------


Create
------
* ``.venv-py311`` is the name of venv folder
* See "Directory Naming Convention" below


Run Ad-Hoc
----------
* Will run python with from virtual environment
* With all the modules already installed


Activate
--------
* ``bin`` for macOS, Linux, BSD
* ``Scripts`` for Windows
* Note the direction of slash and backslash (OS dependent)

Directory Naming Convention
---------------------------
* No standard naming convention
* Naming directory like module (``venv``) name is a good idea
* Adding Python version is also a good practice
* Optionally naming per main framework/library version
* Dot at the beginning hides directory on Linux and macOS (but doesn't work on Windows)
* Underscore is Python convention for private/protected, but does not work for OS and Git


Good Practices
--------------
* ``python3.11 -m venv -h``
* ``python3.11 -m venv --upgrade-deps venv-py311``
* Name venv directory similar to python version ``venv-py3.11``
* Place in your project directory
* Add venv directory to ``.gitignore`` (important!)
* Change prompt by appending at the end of ``venv-3.11/bin/activate``:


Bash Prompt
-----------
* Default on most Linux distributions
* ``\e[``  – This string tells bash prompt to apply color from next character.
* ``0;32m``  – This string represents the colors. The number before the; represent typeface. And the number after the ; represent color code.
* ``\e[0m`` – This string will tell the bash prompt to apply the color to the previous character.


Zsh Prompt
----------
* Default on macOS
* Colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white

Installing
----------
* ``Alt+Enter`` on not existing ``import`` -> Install Package
* ``pip install ...``
