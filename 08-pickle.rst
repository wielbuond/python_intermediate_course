============
* Serialization - writing (dumping) object to string
* Deserialization - reading (loading) object from string
* Used to save state to file or database and resume program later
* User to exchange information between applications
* Pickle - Python native serialization format
* Pickle - supports protocols (compatibility with older versions)
* Pickle - works almost only with Python-Python data exchange
* ``pickle.load()`` -> load from file
* ``pickle.loads()`` -> load from string (bytes)
* ``pickle.dump()`` -> dump to file
* ``pickle.dumps()`` -> dump to string (bytes)
* What if name was ``pickle.from_file()``?
* What if name was ``pickle.from_text()``?
* What if name was ``pickle.to_file()``?
* What if name was ``pickle.to_text()``?


Pickle Dump
===========
* ``pickle.dump()`` -> dump to file
* ``pickle.dumps()`` -> dump to string (bytes)
* What if name was ``pickle.to_file()``?
* What if name was ``pickle.to_text()``?
